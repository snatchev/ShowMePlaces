Show Me Places
============

A simple API built for http://redsnakephilly.org 2014 to showcase Implementation and Performance differences between:

* Lua / Lapis
* Node / Express
* Python / Flask
* Ruby / Sinatra

The API has 1 endpoint: `/:location` which will return a picture of that place.
For best results, try URLs like `/Philadelphia`, `/Manhattan`, `/Costa_Rica`, or `/Canada`
